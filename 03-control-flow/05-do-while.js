    } // This if statement checks whether i is even. Since it's inside a while loop that never runs, this code is skipped.

/* This loop does execute once, because a do-while loop runs the body first and checks the condition afterward.
The if statement checks if i is even (i is currently 2, so it is even).
Then i is incremented to 3 inside the loop.
After that, the condition (i < 2) is checkedâ€”but since i is now 3, the condition is false,
so the loop terminates after one iteration.
In summary, this code prints "Even number 2" exactly once and then ends.
